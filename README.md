My website displays products with a voting system. There will be three randomized generated products on which you can vote on. After each vote three new randomized products will appear and I have set voting to 25 rounds. After the 25th round, the data of products viewed and voted on will appear on a graph. As well as a results button which will give you exact numbers.
